# Hakens DDoS Mitigation
#### Overview
Hakens runs a reliable network and reverse proxy service, positioned between your users and servers. We intercept packets, applying our advanced algorithms to assess the legitimacy of incoming traffic to your service. If we detect invalid or malicious activity, Hakens promptly mitigates it, ensuring your services stay online.
#### Anycast Technology
Anycast directs users to our nearest PoP (Point of Presence), reducing latency and improving response times. It also ensures continuous service availability by redirecting traffic during server failures.
